# Koppee Shop

A modern, responsive coffee shop website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic, accessible markup and structure.
- **CSS3**: For custom styles, layout, and responsive design.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For grid system, components, and fast, mobile-friendly UI.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements (e.g., navigation, smooth scroll, and any future enhancements).
- **Simple Icons CDN**: For real social media SVG icons in the footer.

## Design Choices

- **Color Scheme**: Dark blue/charcoal background with gold accents for a modern, premium look.
- **Layout**: Split header (logo left, nav right), stacked/centered footer with social icons and contact info.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly using Bootstrap's grid and utilities.
- **No frameworks**: Pure HTML, CSS, and Bootstrapâ€”no React or backend.
